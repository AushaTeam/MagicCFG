# MagicCFG
 SysCFG R/W Utility written in Swift


MagicCFG is one of our first, successful applications that we launched last year.
The app makes it possible to read, write and restore important configuration data on iDevices, making it an important tool for hobbyists and professional repair stores. It requires no accessories except for a DCSD cable / adapter and is therefore much cheaper and faster to use than with conventional NAND programmers from the Far East.

Please note that this is a open source version of MagicCFG, which has no diags booting functionality.
This might need to be added by yourself...

This tool is mostly written in Swift and interacts with the syscfg partition of iDevices. 
So be careful in usage and make sure you understand what you are doing!


If you see any bugs or you can code it better, feel free to do it and contribute.
I got my coding skills mostly through Youtube, Stackoverflow and learning by doing, so some code may be just shitty written.
